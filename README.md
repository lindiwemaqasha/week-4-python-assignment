File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
Error Handling Lab üß™: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn‚Äôt exist or can‚Äôt be read.
Outcomes üéâ

By the end of this module, you‚Äôll be skilled in managing files efficiently in Python, ensuring error-free code that gracefully handles unexpected issues. Mastering files and exception handling will allow you to build strong, robust applications!

    Modify the content of the file (e.g., converting text to uppercase).
    You can replace this with any other modification logic.
